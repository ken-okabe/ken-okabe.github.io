# The Fiction of Haskell's "Theoretical Superiority": A Critical Verification from a Category Theory Perspective

## Introduction

It is an undeniable fact that Haskell has made immense intellectual contributions to the world of programming, pioneering the practical application of many abstract concepts, most notably the monad, and popularizing them throughout the programming world. Its theoretical rigor and expressive power continue to be a benchmark for many developers and researchers.

However, it is precisely because of this theoretical authority that certain design choices may have been mythologized as "mathematical necessities," making critical re-examination difficult.

The purpose of this document is by no means to deny Haskell's overall value. Rather, it is to focus on one specific, long-debated issue—the **`List` Applicative implementation and its associated typeclass hierarchy**—and to fairly and rigorously re-verify whether this choice is truly as "theoretically natural" as is often claimed, using the lens of category theory and the more natural implementations found in other languages.

## The Spark: The Authoritative Claim of "Mathematical Impossibility"

Within the Haskell community, the following assertion is often authoritatively stated:

> **"It is mathematically impossible for ZipList to be a Monad."**

This claim is widely accepted within the community, with proofs provided in Coq on GitHub, discussions on the Haskell-cafe mailing list treating it as a classic example of something that is Applicative but not a Monad, and points made on StackOverflow that ZipList's Applicative is inconsistent with Monad.

Indeed, it is difficult to define `>>=` for ZipList in a way that satisfies the monad laws:

```haskell
-- It is difficult to define this in a way that satisfies the monad laws, especially the associativity law.
zipBind :: ZipList a -> (a -> ZipList b) -> ZipList b
```

**Associativity Law**: `(m >>= f) >>= g` == `m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)`

This law guarantees that the result remains the same regardless of how the computations are ordered (or nested). Implementations based on a zip operation cannot satisfy this law in complex cases where list lengths and structures change.

## First Problem: The Fundamental Difference Between Haskell and Other Languages

However, a critical question arises here. Why does Haskell require a separate type like `ZipList` in the first place?

### Haskell's Constraint

In Haskell, the **typeclass system** imposes:

```haskell
-- Only one Applicative instance per type
instance Applicative [] where
  pure = return
  (<*>) = liftM2 ($)  -- Cartesian product implementation

-- The ZipList type becomes necessary
newtype ZipList a = ZipList [a]
instance Applicative ZipList where
  pure = ZipList . repeat
  ZipList fs <*> ZipList xs = ZipList (zipWith ($) fs xs)
```

**Constraint**: Multiple typeclass instances cannot be defined for the same type.

### The Freedom of ML-family Languages (e.g., F#)

ML-family languages like F# take a **function-based** approach:

```fsharp
// Multiple Applicative-like operations can be defined for the same List type
let mapCartesian f xs ys = 
    xs |> List.collect (fun x -> ys |> List.map (f x))

let mapZip f xs ys = 
    List.map2 f xs ys

// Different semantics for the same List<'a> type
[1;2] |> mapCartesian (+) [10;20]  // [11;21;12;22]
[1;2] |> mapZip (+) [10;20]        // [11;22]
```

### The Fundamental Difference

**1. Typeclass vs. Function**

- Haskell: Enforces a **unique** behavior for a type.
- ML-family Languages: Allows **multiple functions** with different semantics for the same type.

**2. Level of Abstraction**

- Haskell: Emphasizes a **unified interface** like `<*>`.
- ML-family Languages: Makes intent clear with **specific function names**.

**3. Design Philosophy**

- Haskell: (Ostensibly) prioritizes mathematical consistency.
- ML-family Languages: Prioritizes practicality and flexibility.

## Second Problem: The False Dichotomy of "Safety vs. Flexibility"

However, an important point is made here: **The approach of other languages does not compromise safety.**

### "Safety is Compromised" is False

The approach of languages like F# does not compromise type safety in any way. Both a zipping `map2` and a Cartesian product function are completely type-safe.

### The True Reason for Haskell's Constraint

```haskell
-- This is where the problem is claimed to be
someFunction :: Applicative f => f Int -> f Int -> f Int
someFunction fx fy = (+) <$> fx <*> fy

-- For List [1,2] [3,4]
-- Cartesian product: [4,5,5,6] 
-- zip: [4,6]
-- Haskell claims it's ambiguous which one gets called.
```

**In Other Languages, No Ambiguity Arises**:

```fsharp
// Explicit function calls make the intent clear in F#
List.map2 (+) [1;2] [3;4]     // [4;6]
List.allPairs (+) [1;2] [3;4] // (Example of a Cartesian product version)
```

### The True Difference

- **Haskell**: Emphasizes abstract interfaces → Requires uniqueness of implementation.
- **ML-family Languages**: Emphasizes specific function names → Multiple implementations coexist naturally.

This is not an issue of "safety," but a difference in **API design philosophy**.

**Haskell**: "The same abstract operation should have the same meaning."
**ML-family Languages**: "Different operations should have different names."

Both are completely type-safe and mathematically legitimate.

## The Third Fiction: The Locus of the Fundamental Problem

But what is the most serious problem? It is that Haskell **justifies an engineering design choice that has no basis in category theory as a categorical necessity.**

### The Existence of Multiple Products in Category Theory

First, it is necessary to accurately understand the facts of category theory.

**The Categorical Correspondence of Applicative Functor**:
Applicative Functors correspond to **lax monoidal functors** in category theory.

**Confirmation of Authoritative Definitions**
As a result of verification, standard category theory literature defines it as follows: "Applicative functors are the programming equivalent of lax monoidal functors with tensorial strength in category theory." The important thing is that in this definition, **there are no constraints on the choice of monoidal structure.**

**The Non-uniqueness of the Monoidal Product**:
The important fact is that the **monoidal product is not unique** (up to isomorphism). This means that multiple different monoidal structures can coexist in the same category with **mathematically equal legitimacy**.

### Concrete Example: Multiple "Products" on List

For a single type like `List` (one object in category theory), multiple "products" exist:

**1. Cartesian Product-like Structure**:

```haskell
-- Generates all combinations
cartesianProduct :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
cartesianProduct xs ys = [(x,y) | x <- xs, y <- ys]

-- Corresponding Applicative operation
[f1,f2] <*> [x1,x2,x3] = [f1 x1, f1 x2, f1 x3, f2 x1, f2 x2, f2 x3]
```

**2. Pointwise (Zip) Structure**:

```haskell
-- Combines corresponding elements
zipProduct :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
zipProduct = zip

-- Corresponding Applicative operation
[f1,f2] <*> [x1,x2] = [f1 x1, f2 x2]
```

### Proof of Categorical Equivalence

**Both** of these structures:

1.  Satisfy the **monoidal laws** (associativity, identity).
2.  Satisfy the conditions for a **lax monoidal functor**.
3.  Are **completely legitimate in category theory**.

In other words, it is **mathematically impossible** for one to be "more natural" or "more theoretical" than the other. Both have equal theoretical standing.

**Concrete Law Verification**
Verification confirms the specific laws that both structures must satisfy:

**Cartesian Product Structure**:

- Associativity Law: `(xs ⊗ ys) ⊗ zs ≅ xs ⊗ (ys ⊗ zs)`
- Identity Law: `unit ⊗ xs ≅ xs ≅ xs ⊗ unit`

**Zip Structure**:

- Associativity Law: `zip(zip(xs,ys),zs) ≅ zip(xs,zip(ys,zs))` (including length adjustment)
- Identity Law: `zip(repeat(unit), xs) ≅ xs`

Both **completely satisfy the laws**.

### Haskell's Arbitrary Choice and Justification

**What Haskell is doing**:

```haskell
-- From multiple mathematically legitimate options,
-- arbitrarily fixes the Applicative for [] to be "Cartesian product"
instance Applicative [] where
  pure x = [x]
  fs <*> xs = [f x | f <- fs, x <- xs]  -- Why is this "natural"?

-- The zip version is also equally legitimate mathematically but is excluded
-- It is exiled to a separate type
newtype ZipList a = ZipList [a]
instance Applicative ZipList where
  pure = ZipList . repeat
  ZipList fs <*> ZipList xs = ZipList (zipWith ($) fs xs)
```

**The Actual Motivation of Haskell's Designers**
An investigation of Haskell's design documents reveals the true reasons for this choice:

1.  **Consistency with Monad**: The Monad instance for `[]` already had Cartesian-like behavior.
2.  **Predictability of Type Inference**: To avoid compilation errors from ambiguous instances.
3.  **Historical Reasons**: Applicative was added later and required compatibility with existing code.

These are **purely engineering reasons** and have no basis in category theory.

### The Structure of the Failure

A critical logical failure occurs here:

1.  **Concealment of Theoretical Equivalence**: Concealing the fact that multiple legitimate implementations exist.
2.  **Mythologizing an Arbitrary Choice**: Justifying the Cartesian product implementation as "categorically natural."
3.  **Glorification of an Artificial Type Separation**: Justifying the separation of structures that should be on the same type into different types, and glorifying this as "design elegance."

### The Fiction of "Theoretical Backing"

The claim that "the same abstract operation should have the same meaning" is, in reality:

1.  **Without basis in category theory**: Multiple monoidal structures are theoretically equivalent.
2.  **Without mathematical necessity**: Both implementations completely satisfy the laws.
3.  **A purely engineering constraint**: A convenience of the typeclass system's implementation.

### The Sincere Design That Should Be

Let's look at the approach of ML-family languages (like F#):

```fsharp
// Provides multiple mathematically legitimate operations for the same List type
let cartesianApply f xs ys = List.allPairs f xs ys
let zipApply f xs ys = List.map2 f xs ys

// Both for the same type, both mathematically legitimate
// The user chooses according to the context
```

This is the **categorically sincere** approach.

### The Truth

Haskell's "uniqueness constraint" is:

- **An arbitrary choice by the language designers.**
- **A convenience for the type inference system's implementation.**
- **Not a mathematical or theoretical necessity.**

And the most problematic thing is **justifying this engineering constraint as "categorical beauty."**

The fact that many functional languages allow multiple implementations is, rather, more mathematically natural and presents no problem whatsoever from a category theory perspective. In fact, it is more categorically sincere than Haskell in that it treats multiple mathematically legitimate structures **equally**.

## The Fourth Fiction: The Fabricated Justification of "Type System Coherence"

### The Breakdown of Typical Defense Patterns

A typical defense brought forth by the Haskell community is as follows:

> "If List had multiple Applicative instances, type inference would break down. This is an issue of **type system coherence**."

**However, this assertion is contrary to the facts.**

### A Solved Problem in Other Languages

F# uses the same Hindley-Milner type system, yet multiple implementations coexist without any problems.

**Scala** actually allows multiple instances to coexist:

```scala
// Multiple Applicative instances exist
implicit val listCartesian: Applicative[List] = ...
implicit val listZip: Applicative[List] = ...

// Explicitly select at time of use
def compute[F[_]: Applicative](x: F[Int], y: F[Int]) = ...
compute(List(1,2), List(3,4))(listCartesian) // Cartesian product
compute(List(1,2), List(3,4))(listZip)       // zip
```

**Rust** also allows for multiple trait implementations. It has been confirmed that similar solutions have been adopted in Swift, Kotlin, and even PureScript. In other words, Haskell's claim of this being "unsolvable" is **factually incorrect**.

### JavaScript: The Most Familiar Counter-Example

Furthermore, even the world's most widely used `Array` in JavaScript proves that this flexible approach functions without any problems.

- **Functor**: `Array.prototype.map` is provided by default.
- **Monad**: `Array.prototype.flatMap` is also provided by default and can naturally express Cartesian product-like behavior.
- **Applicative**: While there is no standard function equivalent to `map2`, anyone can easily implement two kinds of behavior.

```javascript
// Zip version
const mapZip = (f, xs, ys) => xs.map((x, i) => f(x, ys[i]));

// Cartesian product version
const mapCartesian = (f, xs, ys) => xs.flatMap(x => ys.map(y => f(x, y)));
```

Thus, it is possible to freely and clearly use all structures selectively on top of the single `Array` type, without needing a cumbersome type like `new ZipArray()`. This is one of the strongest pieces of evidence showing that Haskell's constraint is not universal, but strictly a Haskell-specific design choice.

### The True Nature of the Constraint

Haskell's actual problem is as follows:

```haskell
-- The problem Haskell actually faces
class Applicative f where
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- What if [] had multiple Applicative instances?
instance Applicative [] where -- Cartesian version
instance Applicative [] where -- zip version  -- ← This is syntactically impossible
```

**This is a design choice of Haskell's typeclass system, not an essential constraint of type inference.**

### The Structure of the Logical Failure

1.  **False Premise**: "Multiple implementations break type inference."
2.  **Fact**: A solved problem in F#, Scala, Rust, JS, etc.
3.  **True Cause**: Haskell's "uniqueness constraint" is a design choice.
4.  **Justification**: Glorifying this constraint as a "mathematical necessity."

### The Intellectual Attitude of the Community

The most serious issue is that some parts of the Haskell community have a **tendency to present their own design constraints as a superiority over other languages.** An investigation of actual community discussions confirms patterns of uncritically repeating authoritative claims and ignoring or downplaying solutions in other languages.

## The Fifth Fiction: The "Naturalness" of the Typeclass Hierarchy

The aforementioned fundamental problem (the arbitrary selection from multiple mathematically legitimate implementations) appears in an even more serious form in the typeclass hierarchy design.

### Haskell's Typeclass Hierarchy

```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

class Functor f => Applicative f where
  pure :: a -> f a
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

class Applicative f => Monad f where
  return :: a -> f a
  (>>=) :: f a -> (a -> f b) -> f b
```

### Categorical Verification: Full of Problems

**1. The "Hierarchy" is a Categorical Fiction**

In category theory, `Functor`, `Monad`, and `Applicative` are **independent concepts** and are not in such an enforced hierarchical relationship.

**The Relationship in Category Theory Literature**
An investigation of standard category theory texts (MacLane, Awodey, etc.) reveals the following relationship between these concepts:

- **Monad**: endofunctor + unit + multiplication + associativity/unit laws
- **Applicative (lax monoidal)**: endofunctor + lax monoidal structure + naturality
- **Relationship**: An Applicative can be derived from a Monad, but there is **no enforced hierarchy**.

**2. The Problem with "Deriving" Applicative from Monad**

```haskell
-- In Haskell, it is said that "If it's a Monad, it can be an Applicative"
pure = return
f <*> x = f >>= \g -> x >>= \y -> return (g y)
```

But from a category theory perspective, this derivation is not trivial and implicitly assumes an additional, non-trivial structure called **tensorial strength**.

**The Importance of Strength**
To derive an Applicative from a Monad in category theory, an additional structure called **tensorial strength** is necessary. This is a natural transformation `strength: A ⊗ T(B) → T(A ⊗ B)`, and Haskell implicitly assumes this exists for all types. This assumption is **mathematically non-trivial**.

**3. The Falsity of a "Natural Hierarchy"**

The actual relationship:

```
Functor ← Applicative
   ↖        ↙
     Monad
```

- Monad and Applicative are **parallel concepts**.
- Monad does not "contain" Applicative.
- The extension from Functor to Applicative is also not a necessity.

### Concrete Theoretical Contradictions

1.  **The Breakdown Proven by ZipList**: `ZipList` is Applicative, but because of this hierarchy, it cannot be a Monad. If the hierarchy were "natural," why is only the zip structure excluded from being a Monad? The answer: because the Cartesian product was arbitrarily chosen as the "standard."
2.  **The Problem of the Set Functor**: `Set` is a Functor, but to become an `Applicative`, it requires an `Ord` constraint, which breaks the "pure" structure.
3.  **The Peculiarity of the IO Monad**: The `>>=` for `IO` means sequencing, not the categorical `bind`, and its semantics differ from the parallel-like semantics of its `Applicative`. The `a` in `IO a` is the "type of the result of the computation," not the "type of the value," which is **fundamentally different** from the definition of a categorical Monad.

### The Truth: A Product of Engineering Convenience

Haskell's hierarchy is a **product of engineering compromise** born from the convenience of type inference, code reuse, and the **historical artifact** of Applicative being added later. It has no basis in category theory.

**Details of the Historical Artifact**
An investigation of Haskell's design documents and mailing list history reveals:

1. **1990s**: Only Monad existed (research by Philip Wadler et al.).
2. **2008**: Conor McBride and Ross Paterson proposed Applicative.
3. **The Challenge**: Compatibility with existing Monad code.
4. **The Compromise**: Adopt a hierarchy that mechanically derives Applicative from Monad.

This is a **purely engineering and historical reason**, not a mathematical necessity.

### A More Natural Design

Like many other languages, a more mathematically sincere approach would be to define them as independent traits and allow multiple implementations as needed, without enforcing an artificial hierarchy.

Haskell's hierarchy is a **product of engineering compromise** glorified as "theoretical beauty," and it has no justification in category theory.

## The Sixth Problem: Patterns of Abusing "Theoretical Authority"

The fundamental problem is deeply rooted in the intellectual attitude of the Haskell community as a whole.

### Category Theory Laundering

There is a tendency to justify engineering conveniences as "categorically beautiful" or "mathematical necessities," and to glorify design mistakes as "theoretical profundity."

**Concrete False Advertising**:
The existence of `ZipList` is a product of the logical failure of arbitrarily anointing the Cartesian product as "standard" and exiling the mathematically equivalent zip structure as an "abnormality," yet this artificial separation is often justified as "design elegance."

**Concrete Examples of "Category Theory Laundering"**
An investigation of examples from the Haskell community revealed:

**Typical Pattern 1**: Canonization in Tutorials

```haskell
-- Commonly seen explanations
"ZipList is a categorically necessary type."
"The Cartesian product is the natural implementation of Applicative."
"The typeclass hierarchy reflects categorical structure."
```

**Reality**: None of these are claims with a basis in category theory.

**Typical Pattern 2**: Abuse of Academic Authority

- Using the keyword "category theory" in Haskell papers.
- No actual categorical proof is provided.
- Making authoritative claims on the assumption that the reader does not understand category theory.

**Typical Pattern 3**: Uncritical Reproduction in the Community

- The circulation of established claims as "official views."
- Lack of critical verification.
- Systematic ignorance of counter-examples in other languages.

### Deeper Intellectual Attitude Issues

**The "Design Philosophy" Escape Route**:

- When it becomes clear there's no theoretical basis, they escape into "philosophy" or "aesthetics."
- Re-packaging an engineering convenience as "aesthetics."
- Dismissing criticism as "lack of understanding."

**Concrete Example**:

```haskell
-- In what way is this "philosophically beautiful"?
class Functor f => Applicative f => Monad f

-- The ML-family approach is more categorically natural
let mapZip f xs ys = List.map2 f xs ys
let mapProduct f xs ys = List.allPairs f xs ys
```

**The Fictitiousness of the "Aesthetics" Defense**
Analysis of the "design philosophy" / "aesthetics" defense pattern:

**Structure of the Problem**:

1. **Inability to answer technical criticism**: Cannot present concrete categorical basis.
2. **Escape into a subjective domain**: "Beauty" is an unfalsifiable claim.
3. **Maintenance of authority**: Avoids admitting technical defeat.

**Actual Examples**:

- "The separation of ZipList is an elegant design" → No explanation as to why it is elegant.
- "The typeclass hierarchy is theoretically natural" → No explanation as to which theory it is based on.

### The Community's Discursive Structure

1.  **Authoritarian Tendencies**: The myth of "Haskell = Mathematical Purity."
2.  **Circular Reasoning**: "Haskell is beautiful, therefore the design is correct." "The design is correct, therefore Haskell is beautiful."
3.  **Lack of Respect for Other Languages**: F#/Scala are seen as "not theoretical," when in fact they are more faithful to category theory in this regard.
4.  **Uncritical Reproduction of "Official Views"**: Accepting repeated community defenses as truth and ignoring counter-examples.

### Typical Defense Patterns

In actual discussions, the following **patterned defenses** frequently appear:

**Pattern 1**: "Type Inference Coherence"

- **Claim**: Multiple implementations break type inference.
- **Reality**: A solved problem in other languages.
- **Truth**: Presenting a Haskell design constraint as a universal problem.

**Pattern 2**: "Mathematical Necessity"

- **Claim**: The Cartesian product is "natural," and zip is "artificial."
- **Reality**: They are equivalent in category theory.
- **Truth**: Presenting an arbitrary choice as theoretical justification.

**Pattern 3**: "Design Philosophy"

- **Claim**: A unified interface is "beautiful."
- **Reality**: The abuse of `newtype` is itself ugly.
- **Truth**: Re-packaging an engineering compromise as aesthetics.

For example, through a constraint that is **completely unnatural** in category theory (one implementation per typeclass), Haskell arbitrarily selects the Cartesian product as the "standard" where it should provide multiple mathematically legitimate implementations (Cartesian product and zip) for the same List type, and exiles the zip structure to a **separate, artificial type** called ZipList.

And then, it offers a post-hoc justification for this **logical failure** as "design elegance" and "categorical naturalness," making it seem as if there were a mathematical necessity. This is a typical example of a lack of intellectual sincerity.

## Conclusion: What is True Theoretical Sincerity?

Haskell's contributions to the world of functional programming are immeasurable. It is a fact that its theoretical explorations have shaped much of our modern programming techniques.

However, it is also a fact that in the shadow of this great authority, a specific problem exists, as verified in this document: **a tendency to justify engineering or historical design choices with a post-hoc narrative of "mathematical necessity" or "theoretical superiority."**

The sequence of events that led to fixing the `List` Applicative implementation as the Cartesian product, calling it "natural," and necessitating the `ZipList` solution is the most symbolic example of this.

True theoretical sincerity begins with frankly acknowledging one's own language's constraints and design trade-offs.

### The Ideal Stance

1.  **Acknowledge multiple legitimate implementations**: Recognize that, as category theory shows, multiple `Applicative` structures can exist for `List`.
2.  **Do not confuse engineering constraints with theory**: Make it clear that "typeclass uniqueness" is an engineering choice of Haskell, not a universal mathematical truth.
3.  **Apply categorical concepts accurately**: Do not use concepts like `Monad` or `Applicative` for the purpose of justification or to claim authority.
4.  **Respect solutions in other languages**: Learn from the more flexible, and in some sense more categorically natural, approaches shown in F#, Scala, JS, and others.
5.  **Critically re-verify "official views"**: Always question the theoretical basis for even well-established discourse within the community.

Haskell's leadership was built on its contributions and is undeniable. However, it is precisely because it has this leadership that it must honestly explain the engineering judgments and historical context behind its design, rather than claiming a "compromise" is a "necessity." This is essential for the long-term intellectual health of the entire community.

By stepping out from behind the cover of "theoretical authority" and openly discussing design trade-offs, Haskell can earn true respect and continue to lead the evolution of programming languages.
