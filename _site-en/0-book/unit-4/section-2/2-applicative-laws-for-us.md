# Applicative Functor Laws For Us

At first glance, checking whether your code satisfies these Applicative Functor Laws might seem extremely cumbersome and impractical for programmers to verify against their own implementations.

However, we are extremely fortunate that the reality is quite the opposite.

**Comparing the three major functional programming abstractions:**

* **Functor Laws**: Abstract properties like `map id = id` and `map (f >> g) = map f >> map g` that produce subtle bugs when violated
* **Monad Laws**: Concepts involving left/right identity and associativity that require deep understanding of computation chains  
* **Applicative Laws**: Simply asking the intuitive question *"Are the inputs independent?"*

**Why Applicative is remarkably simple:**

1. **Aligns with real-world intuition**:  *"Can these run in parallel?"*  is universally understandable
2. **Automatic correctness**: Maintaining independence automatically ensures law compliance
3. **Practical verification**: No complex mathematical validation required

For beginners, being able to create mathematically correct Applicative Functors by simply answering  *"Can these two processes execute simultaneously?"* makes this the most approachable concept in functional programming.

This approach allows learners to start with intuitive parallel processing concepts rather than memorizing complex mathematical laws!

## Practical Note: Independence Implies Law Compliance

**Key Insight**: If you implement `map2: ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> F<'a> -> F<'b> -> F<'c>` such that the inputs `'a` and `'b` are treated as truly independent (non-dependent), then your implementation automatically satisfies the Applicative Functor Laws.

### Why Independence Guarantees Law Compliance

**1. Mathematical Foundation**

- Applicative Functors model **independent parallel computations**
- The laws are specifically designed to ensure operations can be performed in any order
- If your `map2` treats inputs as independent, it inherently respects this mathematical structure

**2. Independence Properties That Ensure Compliance**

```fsharp
// Independent implementation characteristics:
let map2 f fa fb = 
    // ✓ fa and fb are computed independently
    // ✓ Neither computation depends on the other's result
    // ✓ f combines results without side-effects on the containers
    // ✓ Order of evaluation doesn't matter
```

**3. Automatic Law Satisfaction**

- **Identity Law**: Independence means applying identity doesn't interfere with container structure
- **Homomorphism**: Pure values have no dependencies, so lifting and applying commute naturally  
- **Interchange**: Independent computations can be reordered without changing results
- **Composition**: Function composition works because no computation affects another's execution

**4. Practical Examples of Independence**

```fsharp
// ✓ INDEPENDENT - Both validations run separately
let validateUser name email = 
    map2 (fun n e -> {Name = n; Email = e}) 
         (validateName name) 
         (validateEmail email)

// ✗ DEPENDENT - Second computation uses first's result  
let badExample x = 
    bind (fun a -> map (fun b -> a + b) (computeFrom a)) x
    // This requires Monad, not Applicative!
```

**5. Design Principle**

> *"If you can conceptually execute both computations in parallel without any information flow between them, your implementation naturally satisfies Applicative laws."*

**6. Verification Strategy**
Instead of manually checking all four laws, ask yourself:

- Can `fa` and `fb` be computed simultaneously?
- Does neither computation need the other's result?
- Does `f` only combine final results without affecting containers?

**If yes to all, your implementation is mathematically guaranteed to be a valid Applicative Functor.**

This is why  **"Independent Operations = Applicative scope"**  is not just a useful heuristic—it's a fundamental mathematical principle that automatically ensures law compliance.
