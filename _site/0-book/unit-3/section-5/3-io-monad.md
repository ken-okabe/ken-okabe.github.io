# IO Monad

IO, as a Monad, allows chaining multiple IO actions in sequence, enabling dynamic and controlled side-effectful workflows.

## Example in F# (pseudo IO type)

```fsharp
type IO<'a> = IO of (unit -> 'a)
bindIO = fun f (IO action) -> f (action ())

let readInput = IO (fun () -> System.Console.ReadLine())
let printTwice = fun input -> IO (fun () -> printfn "%s" input; printfn "%s" input)
let program = readInput |> bindIO printTwice
// When executed, this will read input and print it twice
```

## Functor (map) vs Monad (bind): Capabilities and Limitations

- Functor's `mapIO` applies a function to the value produced by an IO action, wrapping the result in a new IO action. It cannot control the sequence or branching of side effects; the structure and order are fixed.
- Monad's `bindIO` allows you to execute an IO action, then use its result to determine and execute the next IO action. This enables chaining, conditional branching, and complex workflows involving side effectsâ€”capabilities not possible with mapIO alone.

This distinction is fundamental: mapIO is for value transformation only, while bindIO enables full control over the flow and composition of side effects.
