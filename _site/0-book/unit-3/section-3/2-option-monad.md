# Option Monad

Option, as a Monad, provides `bind` (Option.bind in F#), which enables powerful control over computation flow.

## Example in F#

```fsharp
let safeDivide = fun x y -> if y = 0 then None else Some (x / y)
let result = Some 100 |> Option.bind (fun x -> safeDivide x 2) |> Option.bind (fun x -> safeDivide x 0)
// result = None
```

## Functor (map) vs Monad (bind): Capabilities and Limitations

- Functor's `map` applies a function only if the value is Some, leaving None unchanged. It can transform the value inside Some, but cannot change Some to None or vice versa. The container's shape (Some/None) is preserved, so early exit or conditional logic is not possible.
- Monad's `bind` allows the function to return Some or None, enabling short-circuiting: if any step returns None, subsequent computations are skipped. This allows for safe chaining of computations that may fail, early exit, and conditional logicâ€”capabilities not possible with map alone.

This distinction is fundamental: map is for value transformation only, while bind enables control over the computation's flow and structure.
