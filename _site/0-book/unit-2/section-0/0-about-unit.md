# üîç Overview - Unit 2

In Unit 0 and Unit 1, we built a foundation by exploring the core ideas of functional programming: data transformation pipelines, functions as first-class values, higher-order functions, the importance of types, and how FP handles sequence, selection, and iteration (often through expressions, HOFs, and recursion).

Now, in Unit 2, we will delve into some powerful **algebraic structures** commonly used in functional programming. While abstract algebra might sound intimidating, we will focus on just three fundamental structures:

- Monoid
- Functor
- Monad
