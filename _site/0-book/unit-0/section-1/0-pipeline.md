# Core Concept: The Data Transformation Pipeline

Coding, at its core, is the art of **transforming data** to achieve a desired output.

Imagine a **pipeline** where raw data enters as the input.
Along this pipeline are various **functions**, each acting like a specialized tool that manipulates the data in a specific way.

This **"data transformation pipeline"** is a fundamental principle found widely in computing. For instance, even complex systems like AI often rely on analogous pipelines. **Learned probability distribution functions encapsulated in trained models** act as transformation steps to produce the desired output. This illustrates the broad applicability of the pipeline pattern.

**Functional Programming** is a programming paradigm that embraces this core principle of data transformation.
