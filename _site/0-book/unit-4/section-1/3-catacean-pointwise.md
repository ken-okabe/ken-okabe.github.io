# Product or Pointwize(ZIP)

`map2` is about binary operations of containers, which makes it fundamentally different from Functor's `map` function or Monad's `bind` function, leading to a wide variety of implementation methods.

```fsharp
map2: ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> F<'a> -> F<'b> -> F<'c>
```

### First Branch: Classification by Dependency

All `map2` implementations can be broadly classified into two major categories based on computational dependency:

1. **Independent / Parallelizable**: The two containers are independent of each other
2. **Dependent / Sequential Processing Required**: The result of one computation affects the other

### Second Branch: Internal Classification of Independent Systems

Systems capable of independent and parallel processing can be further subdivided into two categories:

1.  **Cartesian Product**
2.  **Pointwise (or ZIP)**

## 1. Cartesian Product Pattern - The "Multiplication Table" Approach

A **Cartesian Product** generates every possible combination between elements of two collections. It's easy to understand if you imagine a basic multiplication table from elementary school:

```
Ã— | 1  2  3
--|--------
1 | 1  2  3
2 | 2  4  6
3 | 3  6  9
```

Here, each cell in the table represents a unique combination (e.g., 2 from the first row and 3 from the first column combine to make 6). The key is that the result for each cell is independent of the others.

**Why is this great for parallel processing?** Since each combination can be processed on its own, without needing information from any other combination, you can easily split the work among many processors or computers. This makes it highly efficient for tasks that involve exploring every possible combination, like trying out all possible settings in an experiment or generating all unique pairs from two different lists of data.

### F\# List Implementation Example

```fsharp
let cartesianMap2 f list1 list2 =
    [for x in list1 do
     for y in list2 do
     yield f x y]

let list1 = [1; 2; 3]
let list2 = [10; 20; 30]
let result = cartesianMap2 (+) list1 list2
// result: [11; 21; 31; 12; 22; 32; 13; 23; 33]
//  (1+10), (1+20), (1+30), // x=1 with all y's
//  (2+10), (2+20), (2+30), // x=2 with all y's
//  (3+10), (3+20), (3+30)  // x=3 with all y's
```

## 2. Pointwise (or ZIP) Pattern - The "Parallel Matching" Approach

Imagine you have two lists, like a list of students and a separate list of their test scores. A **Pointwise** operation, often called **ZIP**, works by combining items that are at the *same position* in each list. It's like zipping up two zippers, matching teeth that align perfectly.

For example, if you have:

* **Students**: [Alice, Bob, Carol]
* **Scores**: [90, 85, 92]

A Pointwise (ZIP) operation would combine them like this:

* (Alice, 90)
* (Bob, 85)
* (Carol, 92)

Notice that Alice is only matched with 90, not 85 or 92. The resulting collection will have the same number of items as the shortest input list.

**Why is this excellent for parallel processing?** Just like with the Cartesian Product, each pair (or group of matched items) can be processed completely independently. This means you can easily distribute the task of combining or operating on these matched pairs across multiple processors. Pointwise operations are common when you need to perform an action on corresponding elements from several datasets, such as adding two matrices element by element, or applying a function to pairs of values that are already naturally aligned.

### F\# List Implementation Example (Pointwise/ZIP)

```fsharp
let pointwiseMap2 f list1 list2 =
    // Create indexed pairs for both lists
    let indexedList1 = List.mapi (fun i x -> (i, x)) list1
    let indexedList2 = List.mapi (fun i x -> (i, x)) list2

    // Perform a Cartesian-like loop on the indexed lists,
    // then filter to keep only elements with matching indices.
    // This mimics List.map2 behavior without using List.map2 directly.
    let result =
        [ for (i1, x) in indexedList1 do
          for (i2, y) in indexedList2 do
          if i1 = i2 then // Only process if indices match
              yield f x y ]
    result

let list3 = [1; 2]
let list4 = [10; 20; 30]
let result2 = pointwiseMap2 (+) list3 list4
// result2: [11; 22]
//  (1+10), (2+20) - Processes up to the length of the shorter list
```

### F\# built-in `List.map2` (Pointwise/ZIP)

Actually, F# has the built-in `map2` in `List` name space, and it works in the pointwise/ZIP way.

```fsharp
let list1 = [1; 2; 3]
let list2 = [10; 20; 30]

// Apply the addition function (+) pointwise to list1 and list2
let result = List.map2 (+) list1 list2
// result: [11; 22; 33]
//  (1+10), (2+20), (3+30)
// Each element from list1 is combined with the element at the same position in list2.
```

This F# code snippet demonstrates a **pointwise operation** using `List.map2`.

`List.map2` is a built-in F# function that applies a given function (in this case, addition `(+)`) to corresponding elements from two lists. It processes the lists in parallel, taking the first element from `list1` and the first from `list2`, then the second from `list1` and the second from `list2`, and so on.

For our example:

* `1` from `list1` is added to `10` from `list2`, resulting in `11`.
* `2` from `list1` is added to `20` from `list2`, resulting in `22`.
* `3` from `list1` is added to `30` from `list2`, resulting in `33`.

Therefore, `result` will be `[11; 22; 33]`. This operation combines each element from `list1` with the element at the **same position** in `list2`.

What if lists have different lengths?

```fsharp
let list3 = [1; 2]
let list4 = [10; 20; 30]

// The following line would cause a runtime error if uncommented:
// let result2 = List.map2 (+) list3 list4
```

This F# code snippet illustrates a crucial point about `List.map2` when dealing with lists of **different lengths**.

When `List.map2` is used with lists that do not have the same number of elements (like `list3` with 2 elements and `list4` with 3 elements), F# will **throw a `System.ArgumentException` at runtime**. This means the program will crash or stop unexpectedly because `List.map2` expects both input lists to have an equal number of corresponding elements.

Unlike some other languages or functions (e.g., Python's built-in `zip` function which truncates to the shortest list), `List.map2` in F# does **not implicitly truncate** the longer list to match the shorter one.

If the desired behavior is to process elements only up to the length of the shorter list (i.e., to "truncate"), a common F# pattern is to first use `List.zip` to create a list of pairs, and then apply `List.map` to that zipped list. For example:

```fsharp
// Example of how to achieve truncation:
// let truncatedResult = List.map (fun (x, y) -> x + y) (List.zip list3 list4)
// This would correctly yield [11; 22] without an error.
```

### Sequential Implementations with Monads

Finally, we examine the second major category of `map2` implementations: those designed for dependent, sequential processing. Unlike the independent patterns that allow for parallel execution, these implementations are necessary when the computation of the second container is affected by the result of the first.

These sequential versions are typically implemented using the `bind` function from a Monad. The `bind` operation is designed specifically to chain computations in sequence, making it a natural fit for this task.

To illustrate, let's see how a sequential `map2` can be constructed for lists using the list monad's `bind` function (`List.collect` in F#).

#### F# Implementation Example

```fsharp
// This function constructs a sequential map2 using the monadic 'bind' operation.
let map2Sequentially f list1 list2 =
    // For each element `x` from list1, bind is used to start a new computation.
    list1 |> List.collect (fun x ->
        // The new computation is a map over the entirety of list2, using the value of `x`.
        list2 |> List.map (fun y -> f x y)
    )

let numbers1 = [1; 2]
let numbers2 = [100; 200]

let result = map2Sequentially (+) numbers1 numbers2
// result: [101; 201; 102; 202]
```

#### Analysis: Why This Leads to a Cartesian Product

To understand the outcome of this code, we must look at the mechanics of `List.collect`. This function first applies a function to every element of an input list, then flattens the resulting lists into a single output.

**Execution Trace:**

1.  The first element from `numbers1`, `1`, is processed. The inner function maps `(1 + y)` over `[100; 200]`, producing a new list: `[101; 201]`.
2.  The second element, `2`, is processed. The inner function maps `(2 + y)` over `[100; 200]`, producing a second list: `[102; 202]`.
3.  Finally, `List.collect` concatenates these generated lists into the final result: `[101; 201; 102; 202]`.

This process, which systematically pairs every element from the first collection with every element from the second, is the definition of a **Cartesian Product**.

#### A Trivial Case?

This leads to a crucial insight. While this monadic implementation works, it's often considered a "trivial" or secondary aspect when compared to `map2`'s primary purpose. The reason is that `map2`'s unique strength lies in composing **independent** computations, which opens the door for parallelism.

Using the strictly sequential `bind` function forfeits this benefit. It is a powerful tool, but in this context, it's being used for a task that doesn't require its full capability for complex dependency chaining. The monadic framework is flexible enough to also produce a Pointwise result if the dependency is changed to rely on an element's position (index) instead. However, the straightforward implementation above naturally results in a Cartesian product.

Ultimately, this sequential pattern is a fallback for when independence is not possible, demonstrating that Monads encompass Applicative capabilities rather than showcasing the core identity of `map2`.
