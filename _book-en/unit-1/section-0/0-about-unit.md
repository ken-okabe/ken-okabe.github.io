# üîç Overview - Unit 1

In Unit 0, we introduced the concept of data transformation pipelines as a fundamental model for functional programming. This unit explores how we actually build these pipelines using functions as our primary building blocks.

Traditional control structures provide a baseline for comparison as we discover how functional programming offers powerful alternatives through its focus on expressions and first-class functions.
