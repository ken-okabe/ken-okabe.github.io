# üîç Overview - Unit 5

In Unit 4, we established `Timeline<'a>` as our core abstraction for managing time-varying values. Through foundational operations like `TL.map` and `TL.bind`, we explored how `Timeline` enables powerful transformations, integrates I/O operations, and facilitates automatic resource management, all grounded in the Block Universe model and the internal `DependencyCore`. This provided a robust way to handle individual reactive data streams and their sequential dependencies.

The natural next step is to address how we can weave multiple independent `Timeline` instances together to construct more sophisticated and responsive reactive systems. This section of Unit 5, "Building Blocks for Combining Timelines," is dedicated to this challenge. We will explore a range of principled and practical combinators and patterns designed specifically for merging, logically combining, and aggregating information from several timelines. A key focus will be on leveraging algebraic principles, particularly those **of** Monoids, to ensure these combinations are robust, predictable, and maintainable.
