# Pure vs. Impure Functional Languages

The concept of driving code solely through a dependency graph leads us to "pure" functional languages.

## "Pure" Functional Languages (e.g., Haskell)

Languages like Haskell are often termed **"pure" functional languages**. In these languages, the code is, in principle, composed **entirely of mathematical Expressions**. Every piece of code evaluates to a value, and the program's execution is entirely determined by the **dependency graph** of these expressions. The concept of "executing a statement" that doesn't return a value or that modifies an external state doesn't exist in the core paradigm. Everything is a calculation that produces a result, much like how `2 + 3` evaluates to `5`.

This purity means:

*   Code is composed, without exception, **entirely of mathematical Expressions**. Everything is a calculation that produces a result. The notion of a statement that is executed for its side effect, rather than its value, is absent from this paradigm.
*   **Driven by Dependencies:** The order of evaluation is strictly dictated by what expression needs which value.

## "Impure" or Hybrid Functional Languages (e.g., F#)

In contrast, languages like F# (and other ML-family languages such as OCaml) are powerful functional languages but are not "pure" in the same strict sense as Haskell. While they strongly encourage and facilitate a functional style, they also permit imperative programming constructs.

A notable area is how sequences or collections of operations might be expressed. While F# has rich functional ways to handle sequences (like `Seq.map`, `Seq.filter`), it also allows for more imperative-style iteration or **sequential enumeration of steps** that resemble top-to-bottom execution, rather than a strict dependency-driven evaluation for every line of code.

This means you can, for instance, have a sequence of print statements or operations with side effects in a more direct, imperative fashion, although the idiomatic F# style would often isolate these.

## The Trade-offs of Purity

Working with purely functional languages can be a very enlightening experience, deeply reinforcing the concepts of dependency graphs and immutable data flow. However, this strict adherence to purity comes with its own set of challenges:

*   **Steeper Learning Curve:** Managing everything as an expression, especially I/O and state, can initially be more complex and abstract.
*   **Coding Overhead:** For certain tasks, particularly those that are inherently sequential or involve many side effects, the constraints of purity can sometimes lead to more verbose or less intuitive code compared to a hybrid approach. Expressing simple imperative sequences might require more sophisticated functional constructs.

In practice, many developers find that hybrid languages like F# offer a pragmatic balance, providing the benefits of functional programming (immutability, pure functions where they matter most) while still allowing for imperative escape hatches when deemed more practical or efficient for a specific problem. The choice often depends on the specific problem domain, team expertise, and performance requirements.
