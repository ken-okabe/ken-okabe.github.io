# Chapter 4: Aggregating Lists of Timelines

In the previous chapter, we established `TL.And` and `TL.Or` as robust, Monoid-based combinators for merging the state of *two* `Timeline<bool>` instances. However, many real-world scenarios involve checking conditions across an entire collection of timelines.

This chapter extends our logic to handle lists of boolean timelines. We will demonstrate how the Monoidal nature of our combinators allows for the elegant aggregation of multiple timelines using the standard `List.fold` operation, leading us to create the n-ary (multi-input) combinators `TL.all` and `TL.any`.

## The Power of Monoids for Aggregation

The key to elegantly aggregating a list of values lies in the `fold` operation combined with a Monoid. Recall that `(Timeline<bool>, TL.And, TL.TrueTimeline)` and `(Timeline<bool>, TL.Or, TL.FalseTimeline)` are both Monoids. This is powerful because `List.fold` is designed to work perfectly with Monoidal structures. It takes a binary combining function, an initial value (the Monoid's identity element), and a list, then iteratively applies the function.

Because our `TL.And` and `TL.Or` operations are associative and have identity elements, we can use `List.fold` to reliably "roll up" a list of timelines into a single result.

## `TL.all`: Are All Timelines True?

Our goal is to take a `list<Timeline<bool>>` and produce a single `Timeline<bool>` that is `true` only if *all* timelines in the input list are currently `true`.

We can define `TL.all` by folding over the input list using `TL.And` as the combining operation and `TL.TrueTimeline` as the initial value.

### Construction and Behavior

```fsharp
module TL =
    // ... assumes TL.And and TL.TrueTimeline are defined ...

    /// Given a list of boolean timelines, creates a new timeline that is true
    /// if all timelines in the input list are currently true.
    /// If the input list is empty, it correctly returns TL.TrueTimeline (vacuously true).
    let all (booleanTimelines: list<Timeline<bool>>) : Timeline<bool> =
        List.fold TL.And TrueTimeline booleanTimelines
```

When `TL.all [t1; t2; t3]` is called, it constructs a reactive dependency graph equivalent to `TL.And (TL.And TrueTimeline t1) (TL.And t2 t3)`. A change to any of the input timelines will propagate through the chain of `TL.And` operations and update the final result.

## `TL.any`: Is At Least One Timeline True?

Symmetrically, our goal for `TL.any` is to produce a `Timeline<bool>` that is `true` if *any* timeline in the input list is currently `true`.

We define this by folding with `TL.Or` as the operation and `TL.FalseTimeline` as the initial value.

### Construction and Behavior

```fsharp
module TL =
    // ... assumes TL.Or and TL.FalseTimeline are defined ...

    /// Given a list of boolean timelines, creates a new timeline that is true
    /// if any timeline in the input list is currently true.
    /// If the input list is empty, it correctly returns TL.FalseTimeline.
    let any (booleanTimelines: list<Timeline<bool>>) : Timeline<bool> =
        List.fold TL.Or FalseTimeline booleanTimelines
```

This builds a reactive graph where the final result is `true` if any of the source timelines becomes `true`.

## Practical Usage

These n-ary combinators allow for clean and declarative aggregation of conditions.

```fsharp
// Assume validationChecks is a list<Timeline<bool>>
let allChecksPassed = TL.all validationChecks

// Assume sensorAlarms is a list<Timeline<bool>>
let systemAlarm = TL.any sensorAlarms

// As always, for efficiency, compose with distinctUntilChanged
let efficientSystemAlarm = systemAlarm |> TL.distinctUntilChanged
```

With `TL.all` and `TL.any`, we now have a complete and robust toolkit for performing logical combinations on any number of boolean timelines. The next step is to apply this toolkit to more complex, real-world data.
