# Section 1: List Functor and Monad

List is one of the most fundamental Functors and Monads. It is a container for handling multiple values, enabling function application and chained computations via `map` and `flatMap` (also called `bind`).

- Functor: You can apply a function to each element of a List (`map`).
- Monad: You can chain computations by flattening multiple Lists (`flatMap`).

A List can be seen as an ordered version of a Set, reflecting the concept of a collection with order.
