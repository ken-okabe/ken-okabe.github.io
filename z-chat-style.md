Unless otherwise specified, all document output, including code comments, should be in English.

This is for "document output", the usual interaction with the user is user's language (Japanese, etc.)

Fragmentation of documentation is prohibited. Fragmentation of documentation refers to omitting parts of the document by writing things like:

```
 (...the rest of the previous "Explanation of Execution Flow" here...)
 (Example: 1. logTimeline logs "Starting sequence..." 2. stopwatch starts. 3. step0 is defined... etc.)

```

This style, using phrases such as "previous", "rest of the part", "is omitted", etc., to skip fragments of the document, is prohibited.

The reason is that copying and pasting becomes cumbersome. Therefore, always output in a way that allows for direct copying. For the same reason, output Markdown as code so it can be copied directly.
