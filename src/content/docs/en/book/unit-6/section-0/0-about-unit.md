The purpose of this unit is to extend the robust theoretical model established in Unit 5 to more dynamic and complex real-world scenarios. Here, you will master **four practical primitives** built on top of the core APIs of Unit 5 to elegantly solve advanced problems.

1.  **Handling Absence (`n` prefix API):** How to safely and declaratively handle the possibility that real-world data may be `null` within the Timeline structure, without relying on an `Option` type.
2.  **Chaining Asynchronous Operations (`bind` chain):** Building on the foundation of nullability, how to compose potentially failing asynchronous operations into a single, safe, sequential process by chaining `bind`.
3.  **Temporal Evolution of State (`scan`):** A method for evolving "state" along the timeline by accepting new inputs based on past states.
4.  **Noise Reduction (`distinctUntilChanged`):** A technique to optimize performance by capturing only essential changes and suppressing unnecessary updates.

These are a powerful set of tools that specialize the capabilities of the core APIs for specific application areas and are essential for building robust applications.
