Before we get into the dedicated functions for composing multiple timelines (which will be discussed later), let's first see how we can orchestrate a series of operations using the core features of `Timeline`, especially `TL.bind`. This is particularly useful for **asynchronous event chains**. This approach achieves a similar effect to JavaScript's `Promise.then` chain but is realized using only the basic features of `Timeline` without needing additional composition functions. Understanding this fundamental capability of `bind` provides valuable insight into the inherent power and flexibility of the `Timeline` library's design.

## `bind` chain

#### Key Mechanisms

This asynchronous chain is composed of the following three key mechanisms:

1.  **Pre-defined Receiving Timelines**: `Timeline` instances (`step1`, `step2`, `step3`, etc.) are pre-defined to receive the results of each step.
2.  **`bind` Chain**: An asynchronous operation is initiated within each `bind` function. When that operation completes, the result is set to the `Timeline` for the next step using `.define()`.
3.  **Chain Reaction**: When the value of a `Timeline` is updated, the next `bind` that depends on that `Timeline` is automatically triggered, and the chain progresses.

#### Code Example Flow

```javascript
// Similar implementation image in JavaScript
const step0 = Timeline(null);
const step1 = Timeline(null);
const step2 = Timeline(null);
const step3 = Timeline(null);

const asyncChain = step0
  .bind(value => {
    // Start asynchronous operation 1
    setTimeout(() => {
      const result1 = value + " -> The";
      step1.define(Now, result1); // Trigger the next step
    }, 2000);
    return step1; // Return the Timeline for the next step
  })
  .bind(value => {
    // Start asynchronous operation 2
    setTimeout(() => {
      const result2 = value + " -> Sequence";
      step2.define(Now, result2);
    }, 3000);
    return step2;
  })
  .bind(value => {
    // Start asynchronous operation 3
    setTimeout(() => {
      const result3 = value + " -> Done!!";
      step3.define(Now, result3);
    }, 1000);
    return step3;
  });

// Start the chain
step0.define(Now, "Hello!");
```

#### Comparison with `Promise.then`

This `Timeline` `bind` chain is similar to `Promise.then` in many ways.

* **Sequential Execution**: The next operation starts after the previous one is complete.
  * **Value Passing**: The result of the previous step is passed to the next step.

However, there are also important differences in the fundamental approach.

* **Reactive**: `Timeline` is a reactive system that automatically triggers subsequent operations in response to value changes.
  * **Explicit Receiving Timeline**: You need to pre-define a dedicated `Timeline` to receive the result of each step.
  * **Synchronous Return Value**: The `bind` function itself must **synchronously** return the `Timeline` to wait for next, without waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

## Using `nBind`: Towards a More Robust Chain

The code example above is a "happy path" where all asynchronous operations succeed. However, in a real application, you must also consider the **possibility of failure** due to communication errors or unexpected results. This is where `nBind` is useful.

The current code using `bind` has a vulnerability where if any step returns `null`, a subsequent operation will cause an error, crashing the entire application.

| | `bind` (Original) | `nBind` (Refined) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Happy Path** | Works correctly | Works correctly |
| **`null` occurs midway** | **Crashes with a runtime error** ðŸ’€ | **Safely skips subsequent operations** âœ¨ |
| **Robustness** | Low | High |
| **Code Appearance** | Almost the same | Almost the same |

`nBind` is designed to solve this problem elegantly. The operational rule of `nBind` is "**if the input is `null`, pass `null` through without executing the subsequent function**." By simply replacing `bind` with `nBind`, you can give this asynchronous chain robustness without changing the code's structure at all.

In comparison with `Promise.then`, using `nBind` significantly enhances the aspect of **"error handling"**. Unlike a Promise, which catches errors in a `.catch()` block, `nBind` propagates `null` as a "failure" signal safely through the pipeline without destroying it.

#### Code Refined with `nBind`

```javascript
const step0 = Timeline(null);
const step1 = Timeline(null);
const step2 = Timeline(null);
const step3 = Timeline(null);

const asyncChain = step0
  .nBind(value => { // .bind -> .nBind
    // Start asynchronous operation 1
    setTimeout(() => {
      const result1 = value + " -> The";
      step1.define(Now, result1);
    }, 2000);
    return step1;
  })
  .nBind(value => { // .bind -> .nBind
    // Start asynchronous operation 2
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Assume it fails and returns null
      const result2 = null;
      step2.define(Now, result2);
    }, 3000);
    return step2;
  })
  .nBind(value => { // .bind -> .nBind
    // This function will not be executed!
    console.log("This will not be executed.");
    setTimeout(() => {
      const result3 = value + " -> Done!!"; // No error will occur
      step3.define(Now, result3);
    }, 1000);
    return step3;
  });

// Start the chain
step0.define(Now, "Hello!");

// The final value of asyncChain will be null, without causing an error
```

### Conclusion

Using `nBind` is not just about replacing `bind`. It means **refining the code to be more reliable and declarative, taking into account not only the success case but also the failure case (`null`)**. This eliminates the need to write imperative error handling like `try-catch` or `if (value !== null)` outside the pipeline, allowing you to focus on the essential flow of the code.

I've created a terminal-style demo for the Timeline Bind Chain! This demo has the following features:

## Key Features

- **Real-time Log Display**: Timestamped logs for each step
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of the chain's progress
- **3-Stage Asynchronous Process**: A chain of delays: 2s â†’ 3s â†’ 1s
- **Custom Input**: Test with any initial value

## Chain Flow

1. **Step 0**: Triggered with an initial value
2. **Step 1**: Adds "â†’ Processing" after 2 seconds
3. **Step 2**: Adds "â†’ Enhanced" after 3 seconds  
4. **Step 3**: Adds "â†’ Complete!" after 1 second

## How to Use

- **Start Chain**: Run the chain with the default value
- **Clear Log**: Clear the log and progress
- **Custom Input**: Run the chain with a custom value

This demo visually shows that Timeline's `bind` chain can achieve a sequence of asynchronous operations similar to `Promise.then`. You can see in real-time, through a terminal-style UI, how each step waits for the completion of the previous step before executing sequentiallyã€‚
