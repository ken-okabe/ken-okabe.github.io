In this chapter, we bring together the core ideas explored so far and focus on one of the most powerful aspects of functional programming: the unified treatment of state, events, and concurrency.

Here, we will see how functional programming—especially through the lens of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)—offers a cohesive and elegant approach to managing values that change over time, discrete events, and concurrent computations. This unit builds directly on the unifying perspective introduced in Unit 0, showing how streams and pipelines can simplify even the most complex interactive and concurrent applications.
