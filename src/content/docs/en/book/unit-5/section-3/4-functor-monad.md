In the previous chapters, we have looked at two main APIs: `.map()` and `.bind()`. This chapter will prove that these operations are not just a collection of convenient features, but are built on a **mathematically robust foundation**.

## Why Are "Laws" Important? (Revisited)

First, let's briefly review the Functor/Monad laws discussed in Unit 2. Why is the verification of such abstract "laws" important?

It is because by satisfying these laws, the behavior of the API becomes **predictable**, allowing developers to combine and refactor code with confidence. This is not only for human development but also serves as an **absolute foundation** for AI to automatically generate and refactor code, producing robust, maintainable code that is free of logical flaws and bugs.

## Re-examining the Functor Laws (`.map`)

The Functor laws ensure that `.map()` correctly "preserves" the fundamental structure of function composition.

1.  **Identity**: `timeline.map(id)` is equivalent in behavior to `timeline`.
2.  **Composition**: `timeline.map(f).map(g)` is equivalent in behavior to `timeline.map(g << f)`.

<!-- end list -->

```typescript
// Identity function
const id = <A>(x: A): A => x;

// Functions to compose
const f_functor = (x: number): string => `value: ${x}`;
const g_functor = (s: string): boolean => s.length > 10;

const initialTimeline_functor = Timeline(5);

// 1. Verifying the Identity Law
const mappedById = initialTimeline_functor.map(id);
// initialTimeline_functor.at(Now) is 5
// mappedById.at(Now) is also id(5) = 5, and their behaviors are equivalent

// 2. Verifying the Composition Law
const composedFunc = (x: number) => g_functor(f_functor(x));
const result_LHS = initialTimeline_functor.map(composedFunc); // g(f(5)) -> false
const result_RHS = initialTimeline_functor.map(f_functor).map(g_functor);   // f(5) -> "value: 5" -> g("value: 5") -> false

// Both are equivalent in behavior
```

## Re-examining the Monad Laws (`.bind`)

The verification of the Monad laws is done using the simpler and more essential approach of **Kleisli composition**. This is equivalent to verifying that **the composition operator `>>>` for functions that return a `Timeline` (Kleisli arrows) forms a Monoid with `ID` as the identity element**.

### Definitions

- **Kleisli Arrow**: A function with the signature `'a -> Timeline<'b>`.

- **Identity Element (`ID`)**: A function that wraps a value in a `Timeline`.

- **Kleisli Composition (`>>>`)**: An operator that connects two Kleisli arrows with `.bind()`. `f >>> g` is defined as `x => f(x).bind(g)`.

### Verifying the Monoid Laws

#### 1. Associativity

- **Law**: `(f >>> g) >>> h` is equivalent to `f >>> (g >>> h)`.
  - **Explanation of Inevitability**: This law is directly guaranteed by the associativity of `.bind()` itself: `m.bind(f).bind(g)` is equivalent to `m.bind(x => f(x).bind(g))`. `DependencyCore` does not care how you "group" your dependency definitions. Whether you define it in steps `A→B→C` or as a single continuous rule `A→C`, the final information flow path constructed is exactly the same. The associativity law is the mathematical expression of this self-evident principle in the dependency graph model: **"the method of defining dependencies does not affect the final flow of information."

#### 2. Left Identity

- **Law**: `ID >>> f` is equivalent to `f`.
  - **Explanation of Inevitability**: Applying `ID >>> f` to a value `a` results in `ID(a).bind(f)`, which is equivalent to `f(a)`. The `Timeline` `ID(a)` is merely a temporary wrapper to kick off the next computation `f`, and it is self-evident that their behaviors are equivalent.

#### 3. Right Identity

- **Law**: `f >>> ID` is equivalent to `f`.
  - **Explanation of Inevitability**: Applying `f >>> ID` to a value `a` results in `f(a).bind(ID)`, which is equivalent to `f(a)`. This is because the operation `.bind(ID)` is the same as passing the value from `f(a)` downstream without doing anything.

### Verification with Code

```typescript
// --- Definitions ---
const ID = <A>(x: A): Timeline<A> => Timeline(x);

const kleisliCompose = <A, B, C>(f: (a: A) => Timeline<B>, g: (b: B) => Timeline<C>) => {
    return (a: A): Timeline<C> => f(a).bind(g);
};

// --- Kleisli Arrows for Verification ---
const f_monad = (x: number): Timeline<string> => ID(`value:${x}`);
const g_monad = (s: string): Timeline<boolean> => ID(s.length > 10);
const h_monad = (b: boolean): Timeline<string> => ID(b ? "Long" : "Short");

// --- 1. Verifying Associativity ---
const fg = kleisliCompose(f_monad, g_monad);
const gh = kleisliCompose(g_monad, h_monad);

const result_LHS_monad = kleisliCompose(fg, h_monad)(12345);
const result_RHS_monad = kleisliCompose(f_monad, gh)(12345);
// LHS: 12345 -> "value:12345" -> true -> "Long"
// RHS: 12345 -> "value:12345" -> true -> "Long"
// The final Timeline value is "Long" for both, and their behaviors are equivalent

// --- 2. Verifying Left Identity ---
const id_f = kleisliCompose(ID, f_monad);
// The result of id_f(10) and f_monad(10) are both Timelines with the value "value:10", and their behaviors are equivalent

// --- 3. Verifying Right Identity ---
const f_id = kleisliCompose(f_monad, ID);
// The result of f_id(10) and f_monad(10) are both Timelines with the value "value:10", and their behaviors are equivalent
```

## Conclusion: The Inevitability Born from the Dependency Graph

We can conclude that these mathematical laws are not abstruse constraints, but rather **inevitable properties that arise from the `Timeline`'s dependency graph model**.

- **Inevitability of Functor Laws**: `.map()` defines a **static** dependency. Since it defines an immutable transformation rule `A -> B`, it is natural that its composition follows mathematical laws.

- **Inevitability of Monad Laws**: On the other hand, `.bind()` defines a **dynamic** dependency. The structure of the dependency graph itself changes over time. For this complex operation of "dynamic rewiring" not to descend into unpredictable chaos, a mathematical guarantee that the result is not affected by the **order of operations (associativity)** is essential. The Monad laws are the inevitable rules that ensure this **dynamic evolution of the graph is always orderly and predictable**.
