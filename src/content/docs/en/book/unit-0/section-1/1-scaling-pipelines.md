Now, let's dive deeper into the concept of pipelines.

The important thing is that  **the pipeline itself is a function.**

Therefore, it can be used as a component within a larger pipeline.

Then, of course, the larger pipeline itself is also another function.

In fact, a program can be seen as  **a single large function, composed of smaller functions.**

**Building larger functions by composing smaller functions, or pipelines, is a core concept in functional programming.**

This approach allows us to break down complex problems into smaller, reusable components, making our code more manageable and easier to understand.
