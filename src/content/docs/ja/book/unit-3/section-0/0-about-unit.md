  In Unit 2, we discovered two powerful bridges between regular functions and
  container types: Functor and Monad. Through the concrete example of List, we
  learned how these structures enable us to work with containerized values while
  preserving the essential behavior of our functions.

In Unit 2, we discovered two powerful bridges between regular functions and container types: Functor and Monad. Through the concrete example of List, we learned how these structures enable us to work with containerized values while preserving the essential behavior of our functions.

Now, in Unit 3, we'll explore how these concepts extend beyond List to other important container types. Starting from our familiar List Functor and List Monad, we'll discover a family of well-known Functors and Monads that form the backbone of functional programming's approach to handling common computational scenarios.
